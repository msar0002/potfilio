                Greetings! My name is Osama Msarwah, and I hail from the beautiful country of Jordan.
                I am a 25-year-old web developer with a passion for creating immersive online experiences. 
               I pursued my Bachelor's degree in Jordan at the esteemed University of Science and Technology in Irbid.
                After successfully completing my studies, I embarked on a rewarding journey as a web developer
                at Double Support, a prominent company in Amman, Jordan.
                During my tenure there, I focused on back-end development for the mobile team,
                honing my skills and gaining valuable industry
                experience.
               
               Seeking further growth and opportunities to challenge myself, I made the exciting decision to venture to Canada. 
               My objective was to enhance my expertise and acquire a deeper understanding of interactive media design.
                Thus, I enrolled in the Interactive
                Media Design program at Algonquin College. Through this program,
                I aim to develop my abilities in website design and construct web applications from the ground up. 
               The program is slated to conclude in 2024, and I am eagerly looking forward to applying my newfound knowledge and skills.
               
               As I approach graduation, I am enthusiastic about the prospect of finding a rewarding cooperation job where I can contribute
                my expertise 
               and collaborate with fellow professionals to create remarkable digital experiences.
                My journey has been filled with determination and a passion for innovation, and
                I am excited about the future possibilities that lie ahead.
                With a dedication to continuous improvement and a commitment to excellence,
                I am eager to make a positive impact in the world of web development and design.
                Thank you for visiting my page, and I hope to connect with you soon!
